<h1> You ran inside. Or walked inside. Whatever. </h1>
<p> So.. Now what? you are standing in the most ugly, weird, shattered house you have ever seen.<br> It also kind of smells like smomke, which is pretty.. Ew.<br>
You see a dim light coming from your right side. The left side is so dark that you can't really <bold> see </bold> anything in it. </p>

<h2>Which path should you choose?
<a href="left.html">Left </a>
or <a href="right.html"> Right? </a> </h2>
<h1> Choose wisely. </h1>
