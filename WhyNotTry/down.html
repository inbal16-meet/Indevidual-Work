<title>Down The Rabbit Hole</title>
<body> 
<h1> You are going down. (not metaphorically, I hope) </h1>
<p>
You open the secret door(see? I told you it's a secret door!), and you are are welcomed by some light. <br>
You are walking down the stairs, hoping to find something peaceful, like a happy bunny or something.
<br><br>
All you find are two objects standing on a brown table.
<br></p> <h2> What will you choose? <br>
 <a href="sword.html"> The sword</a> or
<a href="bottle.html"> The bottle</a>?</h2>
<h1> Choose wisely. </h1>
