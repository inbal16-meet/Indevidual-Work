<h1> You choose to go to the dark, spooky part. Nice. </h1>
<p>
I appreciate your bravery. You are a true adventurer, huh? <br>
You have reached a dead end. When you reach your hand to the low ceiling, you feel a little hole, but eought for you to fit through. huh. 
<br> On the other hand, you hear a low rumble from the floor, and when you touch it, there is a small bump that feels like a handle.<br>
Secret door maybe? </p>
<h2> What will it be? <a href="up.html">Ceiling</a> or
