<h1> "Aren't you gonna take the sword? For protection?"</h1>
<h3>"Why? I am not afraid."<br>
"Did you come to kill me?"

You see the ghost now. She is small and weak.<br>
"I only came to get some tresure. Although I do dig you"
<h4> The ghost is like "WTF" and you throw the bottle at her.<br><br>
She dissapears.<br>
The rumbling stopped.<br><br>
You won.
